# MotorolaTask
To whom it may concern,



Thank you for considering me for your "Academy" program at Motorola. Here, I would like to share the reasons for applying.



Since I was a child, I've always been surrounded by technology and by computers. One of the most interesting things for me was understanding how this technology works. Growing up, I have been getting closer and closer to this world. Now I attend the College Of Economics And Computer Science in Cracow and I have the chance to learn more about IT.



I have decided to apply to your program because I think about the big opportunities that your company could offer me. In this experience, I will be able to develop my technical skills, working on many projects and different tasks.



Finally, I have found a quote that describes accurately my opinion of how my life as a developer would look like. Coding is linked to the feeling of change that you breathe with it: thanks to it, in fact, the programmer will never stop learning, finding himself "forced" to have to constantly update in order to keep pace with technological evolution in order to improve and increase expertise and knowledge.



Kind regards,



Szymon Sobolewski
